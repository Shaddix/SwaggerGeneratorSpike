# SwaggerGeneratorSpike
This is just a playground on how to use Swagger generator to create JS clients (and consume them without webpack/angular/react/any full-blown framework).

The only really useful file from the repo is generate-js-client.bat (and main.js)
Run it every time your API changes.

See Views/Home/Index.cshtml for example usage in browser.
